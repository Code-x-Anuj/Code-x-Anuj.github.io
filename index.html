        <p class="p">
            Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks or solve problems. It involves writing and organizing code using programming languages to create software, applications, websites, or other digital solutions. Programming enables us to harness the power of technology and automate processes, allowing computers to execute complex tasks efficiently and accurately. It requires logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and attention to detail. In essence, programming is the language through which humans communicate with computers to bring ideas to life.
